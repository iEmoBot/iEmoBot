## üåü Project Overview ü§ñüíñ
iEmoBot Spark is an open-source project for an AI voice emotional robot. With its innovative architecture integrating software and hardware, it redefines the human-computer interaction experience. Breaking free from the shackles of traditional AI voices that are cold, mechanical, and emotionless, iEmoBot Spark deeply integrates key technologies such as basic speech algorithms, speech recognition, speech synthesis, emotion recognition, and LLM (Large Language Model). This endows AI robots with delicate and rich emotional perception and expression capabilities, enabling AI to have "joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness". Whether it's a gentle and healing companion or a passionate interaction, iEmoBot Spark can create immersive emotional dialogue scenarios for users, making every human-computer interaction a touching emotional resonance üíñ!

## üöÄ Core Features Highlights
‚úÖ **Integrated Software-Hardware Open Source**  
The iEmoBot Spark robot consists of software, electronic hardware, and a casing, all of which are open source. Developers can freely modify it, from optimizing algorithms, customizing electronic hardware, to designing the appearance. Your creativity takes the lead, allowing you to easily create your exclusive AI voice emotional companion!

‚úÖ **Lightweight Hardware with Overflowing Emotions**  
Deeply adapted to low-power ESP32 hardware, even with its "compact body", it can respond quickly. Achieving a perfect balance between energy consumption and performance, it enables warm conversations anytime, anywhere.

‚úÖ **Innovation Based on Excellent Projects**  
iEmoBot Spark draws on many outstanding projects. It was originally modified based on the Xiaozhi open-source speech project and seamlessly integrates top open-source projects such as FasASR and DeepSeek. Leveraging these excellent foundations, the goal is to become even better, continuously creating a more intelligent and natural emotional interaction experience, making every human-computer interaction a touching emotional resonance.

‚úÖ **4G/WiFi Dual-Network Mobility**  
The robot is equipped with both WiFi and 4G networking functions, supporting seamless switching between the two networks. No matter where you are, it can stay online, ensuring that companionship is not restricted by geographical boundaries!

‚úÖ **Global Emotions without Borders**  
It supports multi-language interactions, including Chinese, English, Japanese, etc. Whether it's theÂê´ËìÑ tenderness of the East or the passionate expressions of the West, it can accurately convey emotions, allowing the world to experience the warm emotional interactions of AI.
